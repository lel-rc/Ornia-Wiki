# Twin Kingdom of Afesh

The **Twin Kingdom of Afesh** was a diarchy and great power located in the country of [Afesh](Afesh). The Kingdom was unusual in that it had two simultaneously reigning heads of state: the King of the Woods and the King of the Rocks. The kingdom was founded as a union between a human monarchy and a clan of dwarves, hence its dual nature.
