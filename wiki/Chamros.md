# Chamros

**Chamros** was one of the 51 traditional countries of Ornia. Situated around the central Chamric Bay in Eira, it was known for its mountainous terrain and temperate climate. It was the origin of its namesake Empires and Republic. The Chamric Alps surrounding the country, along with land flanking the Bay, made Chamros notoriously hard to conquer by outside forces.

Chamros was the centre of the powerful [Chamric Empire](Second Chamric Empire), where the country was referred to as the *Home Country*.
