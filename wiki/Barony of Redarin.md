# Barony of Redarin

The **Barony of Redarin** was a feudal holding just south of the city of [Haxian](Haxian). It was a major breadbasket for the city, as it was mainly composed of agricultural land. 

It is ruled by the **Baron Redarin**, a noble title bestowed by the [King of Haxian](Naravan). In [The Melody Out of Darkness](The Melody Out of Darkness) it is held by Magnus II of House Arren-Kai, who is serving as the 6th Baron Redarin.
