**Rasteria** (from Elvish *rastri,* lit. "death") is one of the traditional 53 countries of Ornia. It consists of a large peninsula on the east side of the [Azjeian continent](Azjeia), bounded by the Darivian mountains. It is often given the nickname "The Forgotten Kingdom" due to its relative isolation and extreme climate.

The Rasterian peninsula has been inhabited by sentient beings for well over 250,000 years. Its first mention in literature is in the ancient epic the [*Orden-Far*](Orden-Far.md), wherein a clan of dwarves are said to live in the mountains.

## Geography 

Rasteria is located in Eastern Azjeia. It is separated from the rest of the continent by the Darivian mountain range. Its largest city is [Haxian](Haxian).

## Culture

### Farming and cuisine

Flood-resistant crops are preferred in Rasteria due to its stormy climate. The most popular crop is rice; paddies cover much of the arable land in the country. Other crops include root vegetables and legumes such as potatoes, yams, sweet potatoes, and beans. Domesticated varieties of indigenous flora are common, including bendtree and bitter granvi. Wheat and barley are grown intermittently throughout the year, mainly by the Dwarvish population. Dried crops are stored in large underground silos called *altacks*. These silos remain cool and dry year-round - they play an important role in preventing famine after storms and hurricanes. Preservation also plays a key role in the region's cuisine, and food is often fermented in altacks as well.

Large, robust livestock are preferred. Water buffalo is used to till rice fields and as pack animals. Cattle is highly prized for its meat and dairy, with beef making up a significant portion of the country's diet. The domesticated giant mole is an important animal for the Dwarvish population; although other communities merely consider it an uncommon delicacy.

Fishing is common in the region. While the country's extremely shallow waters make large-scale ship-based commercial fishing impossible, many coastal communities subsist on fish. These communities often employ an indigenous form of fishing called *arna,* which involves catching fish by hand or by spear. Skilled *arna* fishermen are much more effective than line or even net fishing in Rasteria's shallow coasts.

The region's Elvish population relies on foraging and hunting, for which the peninsula is quite rich. Wild fruit and mushrooms are common: the most famous is the nutrient-rich bendtree fruit, whose wild varieties are considered vastly superior to their domesticated relatives. The protein source most important to the Elves are Rasterian deer, a large species of deer well-suited to the region's stormy climate.

While the region has developed techniques to mitigate disasters, it is still common for Rasteria to fall into famine. Much of these food shortages come after destructive hurricanes, for which the country is famous. The population most resistant to famine to are the Elves, as they rely mostly on robust native foods.
