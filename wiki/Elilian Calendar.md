# Elilian Calendar 

The **Elilian Calendar** is the global calendar adopted by the majority of countries in Ornia. Originally designed by the famed half-elven scientist Elilianis aven Kirya for the Karzeilan Empire, it was widely adopted around the year AE 100. The calendar used the coronation of the first Karzeilan emperor Arekan I of House nari-Qudon as the beginning of its calendar era: BA stands for "Before Ascension" while AE stands for "After Enlightenment". The calendar splits the 390-day-long Ornian year into thirteen 30-day months.

The naming for months is as follows:

1. Palari
2. Fanait
3. Dena
4. Munto
5. Halar
6. Ledensdale
7. Sarensdale
8. Larant
