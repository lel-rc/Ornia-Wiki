**Welcome to the Ornia Wiki!**

This is a repository of all the writings I've collected over the years of my fictional world Ornia, which I've been developing since 2013. It's also been the setting of several D&D campaigns, and many, many daydreams. This wiki aims to be a completely comprehensive resource for the world and as a place to dump all the stuff I've written.
